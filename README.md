# HPC-Based-Predictive-Healthcare-Analysis-System-
This project develops a predictive healthcare analytics system using machine learning and HPC for early disease detection. We implement a Random Forest model, comparing sequential vs. parallel execution (MPI) to optimize performance. The goal is to improve prediction speed and accuracy, enabling efficient real-time medical diagnosis.

## Overview

The HPC-Based Predictive Healthcare Analysis System is a project aimed at developing a predictive analytics system for early disease detection using machine learning and high-performance computing (HPC). This system leverages a Random Forest model to analyze medical records and improve prediction speed and accuracy, enabling efficient real-time medical diagnosis.

## Objectives

- Develop a predictive healthcare analytics system using machine learning.

- Implement a Random Forest model for disease prediction.

- Compare sequential vs. parallel execution (using MPI) to optimize performance.


## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess medical records for analysis.

- **Model Training:** Train a Random Forest model on the dataset.

- **Noise Addition:** Expand the dataset with added noise to improve model robustness.

- **Performance Comparison:** Evaluate the performance of sequential vs. parallel execution.
