# HPC-Based-Predictive-Healthcare-Analysis-System-
This project develops a predictive healthcare analytics system using machine learning and HPC for early disease detection. We implement a Random Forest model, comparing sequential vs. parallel execution (MPI) to optimize performance. The goal is to improve prediction speed and accuracy, enabling efficient real-time medical diagnosis.
